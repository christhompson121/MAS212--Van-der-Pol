# MAS212--Van-der-Pol
Python code and report for my MAS212 assignment into the Van der Pol oscillator. The final submission of this code occurred in October 2015 (my second year at University of Sheffield). The project centered on the investigation of the Van der Pol oscillator, a natural system which occurs in electric circuits involving vacuum tubes.

The pdf report explains quite concisely the main aims and questions asked of us by our lecturer, I encourage you to give it a read!
